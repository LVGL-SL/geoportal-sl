Fixes and new additions:
 28-Jul-06
- JumpToLine now positions the cursor correctly in IE.
  (It turned out that I had forgot to write the IE specific code ;)

- Find Button now works.
  (I had copied the code from the Jump button, and as a result it checked if the 
  input was numeric, so searching was only possible when the searchstring was a 
  number!)

- Mozilla now does horizontal scrolling in Search.
  Before when searching, Mozilla only scrolled in vertical direction, to the 
  position of the found text.

- The textarea scrolling problem in IE is now (partly) fixed.
  The problem was that once more than one textarea was present, the scrolling 
  would only work on the last textarea. (Wrong variable scope)
  There's still a problem with the linenumbers not getting updated, when using 
  the Cut/Paste functions. To fix this, the "updateNum" function will have to be 
  rewritten.

- Added fix for problem in Konqueror, where the text got deselected after 
  indenting a block.
  (I can't test this myself, so I don't know if it works or not.)

- Added function to Minimize/Maximize textarea, by doubleclicking on the RIGHT 
  side of the topbar. (Maybe it has to minimize more?)

- Added Focus/Blur handler to textarea. When textarea is inactive, the fontcolor 
  is dimmed. (Mainly done for testing purpose.)

 29-Jul-06
- The search function now can continue search from top of document, if no match 
  is found.

- Added function to inject LINK tag on page to load external stylesheet, but 
  removed it again, since the only style that where really changable, was the 
  colors. So instead I'll make the text-, background- and border- color 
  configurable in the setup.

 30-Jul-06

- Added loader for TYPO3's XML language files (locallang.xml). This is a 
  seperate javascript 'class', and can be used in other scripts.

- Added support for external configurations. So far it covers the various colors 
  used, starting with linenumbers turned on/off and starting with wrap turned 
  on/off.

- Corrected bug in resizing when linenumbercolumn was turned off.

 30-Jul-06
- Added some missing onfocus() to various button functions.

- Improved the handeling of the configuration object, and added more options. 
  Now the visibility of the buttons can be turned on/off. Either seperately, or 
  the entire buttonset. The with of the linenumber column is now also 
  configurable.

- Converted the minimize/maximize function into a button. If the textarea is 
  minimized, and the user resizes it manually, the minimine/maximize button will 
  revert to maximized state.

 01-Aug-06
- Added a function to create toolbar buttons, and converted all the other button 
  code into the new format. The new button function sets events for mouseover -
  out & mouseup -down, to create a 'click effect'.

- Fixed a couple minor bugs in the config routines, and added more config 
  options: defaultHeight, defaultWidth, minHeight, maxHeight, minWidth & 
  maxWidth. (Note: They has no effect on textarea yet.)

- Fixed bug in the min. value for Minimizing in IE.

 02-Aug-06
- Added config option for textarea default fontsize.

 03-Aug-06
- Added functionality for the config options: defaultHeight, defaultWidth, 
  minHeight, maxHeight, minWidth & maxWidth.

- Improved the Wraptoggle function. Now Mozilla (and maybe Opera) saves the 
  position/selection before toggling, and restore it again afterwards.

 05-Aug-06
- Now the showButtons option removes the topbar entirely, if set to "0"

- Added a new config option called buttonPath, which is the (absolute) path to 
  the folder holding the button images.

 06-Aug-06
- Cleaned up the Tab handling, and moved the get/set selection to seperate 
  functions, as much of the code is reused in the 2 new commenting commands.

- Now pressing Shift/Ctrl-Tab WITHOUT a selection, also deletes the previous 
  tabchar.

- Added 2 new keyboard commands: 
   Ctrl + numeric * key, which is use to toggle "/ * * /" type of comments on 
   the selected block.
   Ctrl + numeric / key, which is use to toggle "/ /" type of comments on the 
   selected lines.

- Found out why the script disn't work in IE 5. It turned out to be something
  as simple as the style settings for the cursor! Apparently IE5 chokes on
  "cursor = pointer", so I had to use "cursor = document.all?'hand':'pointer'"
  It took some time to find the error, since TYPO3's backend produces a lot of
  Javascript errors. :/
  (One weird problem still exists in IE5: The mimimize/maximize icon is gone!?!)

07-Aug-06  
- Added German translations. (Thanks to Stefan Galinski)

08-Aug-06
- Fixed bug when deindenting in Mozilla.
  Before fixing, the cursor just moved one step back. Thats why I thought it
  was working. (I never checked if the character was actually deleted!)

12-Aug-06
- Added a check, so the script doesn't get applied to textareas which allready
  has been enhanced by the script.
  
- Added an override check to the Javascript code generated by the TYPO3 extension.
  So now the settings defined when installing, can be overridden in other extensions.
  
- Fixed a problem in IE5, where the height of the textarea wrapper doubled up.
  Turened out to be very simple to fix. Just had to move the 
  "this.numwrapper.style.display ='';" to the end of the function. ;)

15-Aug-06
- Fixed a couple problems with the linenumber and wrap toggle functions.
  Now the linenumber column can be turned off at start, and toggling works
  when the buttons are disabled.


16-Aug-06
- Added a new config option called "typo3Colors". Setting this option to true,
  will override the colorsettings defined in the extension, with the TYPO3 
  CSS-classes "bgColor3" & "bgColor4"

- Added Polish translations. (Thanks to Cyprian Kowalczyk)

- Fixed a bug in the Search confirmation box, where the text wasn't taken from
  the locallang.xml file.


18-Aug-06
- Added fontsize changing in Opera. Thanks to Christophe Dolivet for telling me
  how this could be done.
  NOTE: Fontsize changing in Opera, using keybord shortcuts is NOT possible.
  Only the buttons work!
